I have come back from a week long deep-dive into Likelihood-free inference. This conference was mainly focussed on the application of likelihood-free inference on problems in cosmology, however, there were many interesting talks on applications in other areas of astronomy and beyond. This was of particular interest to me as I use likelihood-free inference to infer the physics behind galaxy line emissions using photoionization models.
