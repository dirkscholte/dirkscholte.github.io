This summer I have two summer interns working with me with the help of [SHIFT 25](https://www.shift25.org.uk/). These students are in their final years of school and preparing themselves to go to university. The SHIFT 25 internship allows these students to get a taster of what real science research is like. Read below what they are researching this summer.

Galaxies come in a huge variety of shapes, sizes and colour. To explain this diversity, we need to understand exactly where, when and how galaxies grow over time by forming stars. In this project you study the star forming regions of galaxies. This will uncover the processes that drive star formation whilst we work with some of the most detailed observations of galaxies available. You use observations from the MUSE instrument on the VLT (Very Large Telescope) to identify star forming regions. You also use observations from the ALMA telescope to measure the amount of fuel (=molecular gas) available for the star forming regions. Using these measurements, we can answer important open questions: (1) Why some galaxies form more stars than others? (2) Why are some star forming regions more efficient than others? (3) What properties are most important to determine the number and brightness of star forming regions within a galaxy?

*SHIFT25 is a new campaign led by senior and influential Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic professionals and business organisations. They are striving to equalise opportunities in education, recruitment and progression by 2025. Read their mission statement [here](https://www.shift25.org.uk/our-mission).*
