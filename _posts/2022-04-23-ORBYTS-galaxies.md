We have started a project to get school students involved in galaxy physics research as part of the UCL ORBYTS programme. I am developing teaching materials that will be delivered in two London schools this term. The students will study high-resolution MUSE and ALMA observations of nearby galaxies in the PHANGS survey. These beautiful observations will allow the students to discover the relation between molecular gas and star formation on cloud scales. A challenging project which allows them to do original research on the edge of what is known about galaxies!
