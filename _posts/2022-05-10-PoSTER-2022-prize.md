To my pleasant surprise my poster at the PoSTER 2022 conference on galaxy evolution won the prize for best poster in the session (**$ 70.00**) and best overall poster (**$ 50.00**)! The poster titled *The role of gas in galaxy evolution in the largest surveys* highlights some of my work deriving gas masses for galaxies in large spectroscopic surveys. 

We studied galaxies using photoionization models, which gives us information about metallicity, dust attenuation and gas content. These models describe the physics underlying the emission lines we observe. We use Simulation Based Inference to speed up the model-inference process. This allows us to apply the photoionization modelling procedure to millions of spectra at very limited computational cost.

The poster can be found [HERE](poster_presentation_EAS2022.pdf) and the flash talk is uploaded below:
