# DESI Mass-Metallicity relation

Preliminary result showing the role of gas in the redshift evolution of the Mass-Metallicity relation. This shows redshift evolution between 0 (blue) < z < 0.45 (red).

Gas masses are derived from the spectra using the same approach as in Scholte & Saintonge (2023). We use Cloudy photoionization models to model emission line flux and rely on simulation-based inference to infer gas surface densities from large samples of DESI spectra.
