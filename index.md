# Astrophysicist | Galaxy formation

I work as a postdoc at the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Edinburgh. I am interested in understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies throughout cosmic time. My research focuses on the relation between star formation, chemical enrichment of galaxies and the baryon cycle over cosmic time. Much of my work relies on spectroscopic observations of galaxies, for example from the James Webb Space Telescope and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. 

Some of my main research interests are:
- The accretion, bulk content and removal of gas from galaxies.
- Understanding how complex networks of connected galaxy processes result in tight relations between observable quantities (e.g. the mass-metallicity relation).
- The relation between galaxies and their dark matter haloes.
- Chemical enrichment of galaxies in both the early and local Universe. 

I completed my PhD in Astrophysics at University College London. Previously, I also worked at the Jodrell Bank Observatory as part of their Science Engagement team in the Discovery Centre. I studied for my MSc at The University of Manchester and did my bachelors degree at Universiteit Utrecht in the Netherlands. Originally, I am from a small town in Noord-Brabant in the Netherlands.
