I am a PhD Researcher in Extragalactic Astrophysics at University College London. I study galaxy evolution using some of the largest optical spectroscopic surveys. At UCL I work with [Prof. Amelie Saintonge](http://www.star.ucl.ac.uk/~amelie/) and I am a member of the [DESI](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/) collaboration. I also have an interest in machine learning techniques, particularly likelihood-free inference methods.

Previously, I worked at the Jodrell Bank Observatory as part of their Science Engagement team in the Discovery Centre. I studied for my MSc at The University of Manchester and did my bachelors degree at Universiteit Utrecht in the Netherlands. Originally, I am from a small town in Noord-Brabant in the Netherlands and have lived in the UK for ~5 years.
