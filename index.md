I am a PhD candidate in Extragalactic Astrophysics at UCL. I am studying the ways in which galaxy evolution is influenced by environmental factors using the SDSS and DESI surveys.

I am deriving gas mass estimates from spectroscopy using photoionization modelling and machine learning. Using weak lensing to derive dark matter halo masses.

## Current projects

### The mass-metallicity relation for star forming galaxies with DESI

### The role of gas in the stellar-halo connection

### ORBYTS Galaxies: Discovering the relation between star formation and molecular gas in galaxies
Project using MUSE and ALMA data.

## Previous projects

### Pulsar flux density variability in LOFAR observations
Using simultaneous beam formed and imaging observations from the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) between May and October 2016 we have quantified the variability in flux densities of PSRs B1508+55, B1919+21, B2016+28 and B2020+28. The observed flux density variability can be attributed to a combination of ionospheric disturbances, processes intrinsic to the pulsars and refractive interstellar scintillation. Ionospheric effects severely affected beam formed measurements during 3 out of 28 observations. Significant fractions of the pulsar flux densities went undetected due to shifts in the apparent positions of the pulsars relative to the synthesized beam pointing. Both intrinsic variability and refractive interstellar scintillation was measured using the modulation index and weighted \$$ \chi^2_{\text{red}} $$ variability strength measurements. Interferometric observations facilitated the monitoring of hundreds of sources in the fields of the observations, allowing comparison and quantification of the significance of the measured pulsar flux density variability. This work shows the potential of simultaneous beam formed and imaging observations in the identification of flux density variability. The simultaneous observations provide necessary additional parameters to aid in the identification of the cause of flux density variability at low radio frequencies, where a multitude of different causes affect pulsar flux density. Other current and future low-frequency facilities such as  MWA, GMRT, LWA and SKA-LFAA are likely to also be sensitive to the same sources of flux density variability as found in these LOFAR observations.

This work was done as part of my MSc by Research at the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Manchester.
