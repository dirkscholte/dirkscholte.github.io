# Postdoctoral Research Associate in Astrophysics

I work at the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Edinburgh. I am interested in understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies throughout cosmic time. I am most interested in understanding how complex networks of connected galaxy processes result in tight relations between observable quantities (e.g. the mass-metallicity relation). My work relies on spectroscopic observations of galaxies, mainly from the James Webb Space Telescope and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.

I completed my PhD in Astrophysics at University College London. Previously, I also worked at the Jodrell Bank Observatory as part of their Science Engagement team in the Discovery Centre. I studied for my MSc at The University of Manchester and did my bachelors degree at Universiteit Utrecht in the Netherlands. Originally, I am from a small town in Noord-Brabant in the Netherlands.
