# Astrophysicist | Galaxy formation

I am a researcher at the Institute for Astronomy at the Royal Observatory Edinburgh, where I focus on understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. My work explores how star formation, chemical enrichment, and the baryon cycle interact and evolve throughout the history of the Universe. I primarily use spectroscopic observations, including from the James Webb Space Telescope and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, to probe these processes.

**My research interests include:**
- The accretion, retention, and removal of gas from galaxies.
- Understanding how interconnected galaxy processes lead to tight correlations between observable properties (e.g., the mass-metallicity relation).
- The relationship between galaxies and their dark matter haloes.
- The chemical enrichment of galaxies in both the early and local Universe.


I currently co-chair the galaxy and quasar physics working group in the DESI collaboration. I completed my PhD in Astrophysics at University College London and have a strong background in science engagement, having previously worked with the Jodrell Bank Observatory's Science Engagement team in the Discovery Centre. My MSc is from The University of Manchester, and I earned my bachelor's degree at Universiteit Utrecht in the Netherlands. I am originally from a small town in Noord-Brabant, the Netherlands.
