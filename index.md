# Dirk Scholte

I am a PhD candidate in Extragalactic Astrophysics at UCL. I am studying the ways in which galaxy evolution is influenced by environmental factors using the SDSS and DESI surveys.

I am deriving gas mass estimates from spectroscopy using photoionization modelling and machine learning. Using weak lensing to derive dark matter halo masses.

## Current projects

### The mass-metallicity relation for star forming galaxies with DESI

### The role of gas in the stellar-halo connection

## Previous projects

### Pulsar flux density variability in LOFAR observations
