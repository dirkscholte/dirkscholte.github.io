#### Atomic gas sequence
Measurements of the atomic gas sequence for a mass complete sample of galaxies: [Download here]().

You can use the function below to plot the function we fitted to the data:
```python
def fhi(mstar):
    '''The atomic gas sequence of a mass complete sample of galaxies.'''
    return
```
#### Mass-metallicity relation
Measurements of the mass-metallicity relation for an emission line flux limited sample of galaxies: [Download here]().

You can use the function below to plot the function we fitted to the data:
```python
def mzr(mstar):
    '''The mass-metallicity relation for an emission line flux limited sample'''
    return
```
